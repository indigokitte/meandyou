        <p>I love you and words cannot even begin to describe it. This feeling is so surreal it feels like a movie.
            There are three things that are constant in the world: the sun will rise, the wind will blow and<span> my love for you will grow.</span>
            You are not just my boyfriend but my best friend, a shoulder to lean on, the one I laugh with and gossip with. I forever wish to
            be the same for you. You are like a ray of light in dark places. Whenever things get rough and i lose hope you are always there to
            make me feel like myself again. No one else can take your place. Even if you decide to leave.
            My heart will forver belong to you.
            I see you in every sunset.
            <div class="orange">
            You are my <span>orange.</span>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            With a heart like yours, you deserve the world.
            You are my home.
            With you, i feel peace.
            I want to be you idea of perfect.<br>
            I want to spend all your good and bad days with you, to be by your side when you need me to be. To hold you, to love you.
            You are better than the boys in the books i've read, you are far more glorius. 
            Like Atticus said:<br>
                                    "When I think of you
                                    I find it hard to belive
                                    that the whole universe had not conspired
                                    to bring you to life.
                                    I cannot think of a more beautiful reason
                                    for it all to exist
                                    than for you in this day."
            Being with you was like arriving home to a place I had never been but had been yearning for my whole life.
            Your laugh,
            Your smile,
            Your beautiful brown eyes,
            That little dimple that always makes an apperance of your beautiful skin.
            I pinky promise to annoy you forever.<br>
            A little poem for you:<br>
                                    "you and the chaos you carry.
                                    a tornado on two legs
                                    the finality of the thunder
                                    the bitter cry of the rain.
                                    nothing hits the ground without an echo.
                                    no disaster walks away unscathed.
                                    even if it is a scrape on my elbow
                                    or a cut on my knee
                                    a slightly btattered heart i want you to know that i see you.
                                    i want you to know that i am not afraid of your storms."
            I love you for eternity.<br>
